# CourseCatchr
Choose your courses without the catch!

As university students, figuring out degree requirements and eligible elective courses is a huge hassle.  
Why scroll through an entire database of courses, when you can create a list of useful courses with just the click of a button! 
Introducing, CourseCatchr, the app that filters out your unwanted courses for you!

Real-time database was created using Firebase to retrieve elective courses provided by UWaterloo. 

This is a Hack the North project.

Some References: These are the tutorials and GitHubs that were used most extensively throughout the project.
